A central concept of Kaizen is that significant results come from many small changes accumulated over time.</p><p>Hence for us to become <strong>dramatically</strong> better over time - we make small improvements, one day at a time.</p><p>The surest way we can become better is to become more knowledgeable so that we can gain deeper understanding through applying the knowledge we've acquired. We are therefore able to <strong>make better decisions</strong> over time.</p></div><div class=col-md-6><p>In the world we live, <strong>the Internet</strong> is a major tool of knowledge acquisition - for good and for bad.
